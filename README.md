# kanvas
### In this code we constructed and drew a form to calculate a rectangle space, when:
* The form contains inputs that get the sides of the square (2 sides), each side in a separate input.
* The form contains inputs that get the square position (point x, y), each value in a separate input.
* The form contains a label that displays the results of the square area.
* By pressing the button, the function will draw on the canvas parallel to calculating the square entered.
* By clicking on the canvas the value of the point will be saved and clicking on the square button will appear at the saved point.
* The square will be painted on the canvas only if it does not exceed the canvas. If it exceeds - a message will be issued.
* Another function is that when the page is raised, it automatically draws squares on the canvas until it is blacked out (the lengths of the sides are randomized). To activate it, release the appropriate code section from the comment.
